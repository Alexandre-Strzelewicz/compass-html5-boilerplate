// First, set some default constants
// to be used by html5-boilerplate
@import "partials/base";

// Then, we'll import the compass extension
@import "html5-boilerplate";

// Now you can choose to include the
// whole enchilada with just one line
//@include html5-boilerplate;

// Or, you can pick and choose only the
// sections you want to include
//@include html5-boilerplate-reset;
//@include html5-boilerplate-fonts;
//@include html5-boilerplate-page;
//@include html5-boilerplate-helpers;
//@include html5-boilerplate-media;
